## Project: Prep #1

### Conflict Plan

* What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  * Voting. Address conflict right away. Be honest with each other if something isn’t working. Honesty and transparency. Make sure to document things and take really good notes in our code to avoid conflict; be descriptive with the variable names and function calls. 
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * Daily accountability checks. Clear and strong communication. Recognize that getting stuck on something is very different than not trying. If you get stuck, ask for help. We are a team; we’re not doing this alone. It will be clear from the Trello cards who is not being accountable
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  * We all have bad days, but if you’re slacking for more than 1 day that’s when we will escalate


### Communication Plan

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  * Slack for communications. Try to stick to 9a-5p west coast 12p-8p east coast
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  * Team stand ups in the morning, afternoon, and evening where we each take turns discussing our goals and progress. 
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * We all feel confident in our ability to speak up.


### Work Plan

* How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? What project management tool will be used?
  * Trello! Try to make big picture goals as a team on Monday, and set smaller daily goals each morning before we work.


### Git Process

* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  * Our repository and our project details in the README.md
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  * We will make a GitHub organization and all be collaborates
* What is your Git flow?
  * Pulls in the morning, pushes and merges at the end of the day. Make it so no one can accidentally push to the main branch. Have 1 reviewer before you can merge branches back to main
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  * How many people must review a PR? 1 additional person
  * Who merges PRs? We will do this daily as a team
  * How often will you merge? Once a day as a team, more if necessary 
  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? End of day, or via slack if you are doing work after hours.
